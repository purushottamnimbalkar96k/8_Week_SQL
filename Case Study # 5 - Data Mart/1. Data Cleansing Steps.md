## :shopping_cart: Case Study #5: Data Mart - Data Cleansing Steps

In a single query, perform the following operations and generate a new table in the data_mart schema named clean_weekly_sales:

- Convert the week_date to a DATE format
- Add a **week_number** as the second column for each week_date value, for example any value from the 1st of January to 7th of January will be 1, 8th to 14th will be 2 etc
- Add a **month_number** with the calendar month for each week_date value as the 3rd column
- Add a **calendar_year** column as the 4th column containing either 2018, 2019 or 2020 values
- Add a new column called **age_band** after the original segment column using the following mapping on the number inside the segment value

- Add a new **demographic** column using the following mapping for the first letter in the segment values

- Ensure all null string values with an "unknown" string value in the original segment column as well as the new age_band and demographic columns
- Generate a new **avg_transaction** column as the sales value divided by transactions rounded to 2 decimal places for each record
